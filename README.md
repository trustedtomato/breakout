# Breakout
Enhanced HTML/CSS/JS version of the famous breakout game.

## Why?
There are a lot of breakout games already:
- MDN's tutorial's result: https://jsfiddle.net/end3r/9temh0ta/embedded/result/
- Codein inComplete's take: https://codeincomplete.com/games/breakout/
- Phaser's example: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/breakout
- a *lot* of flash game

But what I didn't find in neither of them is proper & efficient collision detection.
So thats what I did.

## Browser compatibility
- Chrome 61
- Firefox 59
- Opera 51
*If you find a browser which works too, please send a pull request!*

## Contribution
The code is pretty simple and readable.
If you find a bug, I would love to see a fix pull request.
I fix bugs tho.
